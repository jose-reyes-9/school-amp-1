<!-- Spotlight Description -->
<p>Spotlight recognizes one student in our Viking community each month. This
  forum highlights students for their character and impressive accomplishments.
  WSHS Amplified and the Student Activities Leadership Council both believe that
  students of our community deserve to have their stories told. If you know
  someone who should be highlighted, please visit our
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/contact">contact page</a>.</p>

<!-- Intro About -->
<p>Welcome all from the Viking Community! Some of you have heard of Amplified
  and some have not. Below we explain exactly what we do, and why it impacts
  you, your school, and most importantly your education.</p>

<!-- What does it do? -->
<h1>What does Amplified do?</h1>
<p>Amplified has partnered up with administration to give students the most
  impactful voice that has ever been seen in a learning environment. With the
  admin team open for discussions and the help of teachers, we can develope
  solutions that work for everyone. This is your environment, your education,
  your community, and your voice. This is Amplified.</p>

<!-- Who is behind this? -->
<h1>Who runs Amplified?</h1>
<p>Many are concerned about anonymous comments and punishment for expressing
  their opinions on this site. We are proud to announce that Amplified is
  entirely run by students, and no one can be punished for expressing their true
  and respectful opinions. After all, we are <strong>your</strong> voice!</p>

<!-- How does it work -->
<h1>How it works?</h1>
<p>Amplified makes it simple for your voice to be heard. Once you read the blog,
  express your opinions and solutions in the comment section which is located at
  the end of each blog. We will take care of the rest and meet with admin to
  discuss solutions that you suggested in order to better learning environments
  for everyone.</p>

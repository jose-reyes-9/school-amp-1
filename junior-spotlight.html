custom-question4: "What has been your favorite memory of high school so far?"

custom-answer1: "With most of our team last year being seniors, I’m excited to see us work together and build a stronger bond throughout the season with new players and new strengths."
custom-answer2: "I’m excited to be a senior, but I’m more excited for class of 2018 to come together and unite as we go through our last year of high school. Experiencing all the senior activities is what we’ve been waiting for since freshman year and the most exciting part is to experience it with some of my closest friends. "
custom-answer3: "Its challenging to keep up with school and sports but whenever I have an opportunity to do homework I do it immediately. Staying up late or waking up earlier is helpful since I have no distractions and can finish my assignments. Being organized is beneficial when I know what upcoming plans are if it’s a game or a meeting or an assignment due. "
custom-answer4: "Sadies my sophomore year is my favorite memory when girls had such cute proposals and the dance was so much fun even if you didn’t have a date. I’ve enjoyed sadies since freshman year but it was definitely much better last year."

set-answer1: "I try to do something that can better myself or others around me like a simple gesture or comment that could possibly brighten the mood. Experiencing new things and making an impact is a good way for me to follow the school theme every day."
set-answer2: "Woodbridge by far has the best school spirit and that’s what makes us special. From football games to hockey games to everyday activities everyone knows how to make the best out of it and have a good time. "
set-answer3: "I plan on going to college somewhere in North Carolina to study human development and family studies or early childhood education."
set-answer4: "Don’t wish away your high school years and enjoy every minute. Involve yourself in as many activities as you can and remember that every year counts so don’t slack off."
set-answer5: "Three words to describe me would be enthusiastic, genuine, and outgoing."
set-answer6: "I try to smile or say hi to people in the halls so they can at least see a small amount of kindness before class and will eventually pay it forward. Being your own person instead of trying to impress others goes a long way and inspires others to be themselves."

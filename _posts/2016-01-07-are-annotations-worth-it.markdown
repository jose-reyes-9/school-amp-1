<!-- Start -->
<p>Annotations, a true example of a double-edged sword. They can kill reading or save reading for students. Annotations, the anti-hero? Our English Department here at Woodbridge varies in their implementation of annotations.</p>

<p>Some teachers, both AP and not AP, utilize annotations by obligating students to look for six regarding targets. Those targets are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Main Idea, Author’s Purpose, and Supporting Details</li>
  <li>Literary Devices</li>
  <li>Context</li>
  <li>Author’s Voice and Style</li>
  <li>Comparing and Contrasting</li>
  <li>Making Inferences Drawing Conclusions</li>
</ul>

<!-- Intro with quote from Mrs.Morse and explanation -->
<h2 class="section-heading">Exploring Both Sides</h2>

<p>Some of the instructors here at Woodbridge use symbols while others use color-coding. These tactics are intended as tools for students to identify the targets and analyze the literature. Mrs. Morse, an annotation advocate in the department, says</p>

<blockquote>Annotating serves as a visual marker and a physical connection with the text. The structure provided by teachers is often just a way to show students new ways to look at text, but in reality, annotation should be organic to the reader.</blockquote>

<p>Her point is understandable; she is providing the students with guidelines for their annotations, this way they can have a different perspective on the text. The students may deeper explore the targets, and discover that annotations are a natural part of reading.</p>

<!-- Student quote from 11th grader with explanation -->
<p>Students in these courses all respond differently. 11th grade student Sergio Blacutt, says</p>

<blockquote>In my opinion, annotations don’t help, and I think I speak for the vast majority of my class when I say that. Not only are they not liked, but they are very stressful. There is not one day where I can read a book without annotating for something, it really takes away the joy of reading for me.</blockquote>

<p>11th grade is a big year. Both the Writing and Reading SOL’s reside during this year and they are graduation requirements. Could annotations, whether you like it or not, be the determining factor that gets students over the passing score of 400? Well, Reading SOL scores have gone up 4 percent since 2014, the year in which these targets were put in place and mainstreamed throughout the department.</p>

<!-- Not every teacher does this. Quote from Mr.Trott with explanation -->
<h2 class="section-heading">Do Students Miss It?</h2>

<p>However, not every teacher pushes their students to color-code or create symbols or even annotate at all. However, this doesn’t mean that these instructors are against annotations or don’t see the value. Mr. Trott, Pre-AP English 10 and AP Lang. instructor, comments</p>

<blockquote>Annotating a text for a deeper and richer understanding is a vital skill to have. It should be taught in all introductory classes as a means of observing patterns and analyzing meaning, purpose and audience. It’s imperative for students to learn this skill as they begin to tackle complex textbook chapters, essays, speeches, poems and short prose. However, when it pertains to longer texts, like a novel or novella, I think a more focused approach is necessary. I believe annotating novels should be limited to one or two targets that will later be utilized in a piece of writing, teaching, or discussion. This allows for a focused approach for mastery and preserves the appreciation for and enjoyment of the text.</blockquote>

<!-- Do students miss it? Quote from 10th grader -->
<p>But… do students who are used to annotations in previous courses miss the enforcement of writing in their books? Well, Tyler Donovan, 10th grade student, remarks</p>

<blockquote>Yes because they helped me keep track of all my thoughts and questions about the text I was working with.</blockquote>

<p>Although annotations may just be a matter of preference, research tells us:</p>

<!-- Writing things down section -->
<h2 class="section-heading">Theres a method to the madness</h2>

<p>In a study done, there were two groups of students. One group annotated as they read, and one did not. The results concluded that both groups retained about 40 percent of information, but the group that annotated could better recall the key points.</p>

<p>So Vikings, here’s where you come in. The English Dept. needs your voice and ideas. Sound off in the comments below.</p>

<p>Do annotations help you? Why and how? What do you like about annotating? Why should English instructors keep them?</p>

<p>Do annotations deter you from reading? What about them don’t you like? Do you have input or ideas of how teachers could utilize them?</p>

<p>Vikings- be constructive! We need your input!</p>

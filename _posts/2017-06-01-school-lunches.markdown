<!-- Ms. Landes Quote -->
<blockquote>I have seen certain students being matched with tutors, and once the other freshman saw the progress, it was something they wanted for themselves. Soon everyone was asking for personal tutors to aid them in setting, chasing, and achieving their goals. I am hoping that in the near future, all students will see how beneficial goals can be for their futures, their education, and for themselves.</blockquote>

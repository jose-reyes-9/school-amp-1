<!-- Start -->
<p>When trying something for the first time, it’s not always easy to adjust to those changes. Similar to when flex periods were first brought to Woodbridge,  students nor teachers had ever really tried it. As time passed we became accustomed to flex, and they just adapted themselves into our schedule. Although flex periods seemed great theoretically, they were perceived in many different ways by the Viking community.</p>

<!-- Twitter poll -->
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Blog poll:<br>What do you WANT to use flex for?</p>&mdash; WSHS Amplified (@WSHSAmplified) <a href="https://twitter.com/WSHSAmplified/status/837080783441494016">March 1, 2017</a></blockquote>

<!-- Intro -->
<h2 class="section-heading">The Data Doesn't Lie</h2>
<p>Another poll was released to gather data on what student and teachers thought on this question: “What ideas do you believe would work best during the FLEX periods”? The results helped further prove that change could be extremely beneficial for the classrooms and student success. Below are some of the ideas gathered from the survey.</p>

<!-- Data list google forms -->
<ul>
  <li>52% Club Meetings</li>
  <li>48% Group projects/activities in core subjects</li>
  <li>44% Assemblies for art programs</li>
  <li>44% Assemblies for classes</li>
  <li>32% Mentoring programs</li>
  <li>32% Practice time for arts</li>
</ul>

<!-- Data explanation -->
<p>In addition to these choices, the Viking community submitted options of their own. All of which suggested study time and student tutoring as an alternative during flex. From this data we can infer that although FLEX periods are decent, they are nowhere near where they should be to meet both student and teacher needs.</p>

<!-- Viking Perspectives section -->
<h2 class="section-heading">Viking Perspectives</h2>
<p>From speaking to teachers, we find that most of them allow students to FLEX out based on their current academic standing. Ms. Greenfield, a mathematics teacher here at Woodbridge states the following.</p>

<!-- Greenfield quote -->
<blockquote>I do allow my students to flex out based on their current performance in my class. Obviously a student who is struggling in class needs to be in the flex period to use that time to catch up.</blockquote>

<p>She also mentions a small tutoring program that runs during FLEX specifically for math students.</p>

<!-- Quote continued -->
<blockquote>Our tutors are strong math students and provide assistance to other students in the senior lounge during flex periods. Students are able to flex into the senior lounge from any of their classes just like the normally would, only they are flexing in to get help from a peer and not a teacher.</blockquote>

<p>She claims,</p>

<blockquote>This has been a great success this year and is something I would like to see implemented on a much larger scale down the road.</blockquote>

<p>This is a way students can help other students and learn to grow from one another. This further helps develope relationships between students as well as create a sense of security through empathy.</p>

<!-- Ms. Dobson quote -->
<p>Ms. Dobson, the teacher for the deaf and hard of hearing, states</p>

<!-- Dobson quote -->
<blockquote>I think FLEX periods are really good for students to preview assessments, complete homework assignments, and work on special projects.</blockquote>

<p>After using FLEX periods for two years, a junior, says</p>

<!-- Junior quote -->
<blockquote>It is very beneficial for students who cannot stay after school</blockquote>

<p>According to these two quotes, the FLEX periods are being used, and they are helping students complete assignments, and stay caught up on work.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What is the Full Policy?</h2>
<p>Mr. Mathison, an assistant principal, provided us with an exclusive look at the <a href="https://wshsamplified.com/extras/flex-policy.pdf">FLEX policy</a>. He also answered a few questions regarding FLEX that can be found <a href="#">here</a>. It clearly states that during FLEX there cannot be any new instruction, and that there is to be no down time. If we refer back to the data gathered from the twitter polls, we can observe that students rated free time the highest on both occasions. What is to be said for this?</p>

<p>There are many alternatives to free time that could be implemented within the classrooms. These activities would not disregard learning entirely, but it would not limit students to a rigid system.</p>

<p>Team building activities, sport club meetings, and other activities could allow students to take a break from the education system, but not from learning. Research proves that time off assignments, which allow students to learn while they rest, is imperative for right and proper functioning of brain and our overall health. How are we allowing our students to go without breaks during the day, and then expecting them to perform at their full potential?</p>

<p>Annotations, a true example of a double-edged sword. They can kill reading or save reading for students. Annotations, the anti-hero? Our English Department here at Woodbridge varies in their implementation of annotations.</p>

<p>Some teachers, both AP and not AP, utilize annotations by obligating students to look for six regarding targets. Those targets are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Main Idea, Author’s Purpose, and Supporting Details</li>
  <li>Literary Devices</li>
  <li>Context</li>
  <li>Author’s Voice and Style</li>
  <li>Comparing and Contrasting</li>
  <li>Making Inferences Drawing Conclusions</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the instructors here at Woodbridge use symbols while others use color-coding. These tactics are intended as tools for students to identify the targets and analyze the literature. Mrs. Morse, an annotation advocate in the department, says,</p>

<blockquote>Annotating serves as a visual marker and a physical connection with the text. The structure provided by teachers is often just a way to show students new ways to look at text, but in reality, annotation should be organic to the reader.</blockquote>

<p>Her point is understandable; she is providing the students with guidelines for their annotations, this way they can have a different perspective on the text. The students may deeper explore the targets, and discover that annotations are a natural part of reading.</p>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>

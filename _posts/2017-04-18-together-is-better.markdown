<!-- Start -->
<p>The bond between students and teachers is imperative to their success. Many times the relationship between students and teachers is
misunderstood. One party feels that the other is not doing enough, while the other party thinks they are already doing too much.  A good
relationship is not always encouraged within the educational system; because the system dictates that the purpose of school for a student 
is to get a superficial grade, not to build relationships that will encourage personal growth and individual development. As for teachers,
the system dictates that they must have passing students, not inspired and motivated ones.

<!-- Twitter Polls-->

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How many teachers do you feel comfortable with this year?</p>&mdash;

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Do you think having a positive relationship with your teachers correlates with your grades? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AprilBlogComing?src=hash">#AprilBlogComing</a></p>&mdash; WSHS Amplified (@WSHSAmplified) <a href="https://twitter.com/WSHSAmplified/status/849419725142708224">April 5, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>The twitter poll shows us that students only have around 1-2 teachers they feel comfortable with, and at the same time, they feel that
a relationship has a significant impact on grades. Take a close look at both polls, it is evident that the community is not experiencing
this needed relationship.

<!-- Improving Together Section -->
<h2 class="section-heading">Improving Learning Together</h2>
<p>A relationship characterized by agreement, mutual understanding, or empathy that makes communication possible, is the ideal relationship between students and teachers. Classrooms will thrive on this understanding and caring relationship. A recent study conducted by RAND Corporation’s education branch suggests that a teacher’s impact on student success remains consistent even if the teacher changes schools. The teacher still affects the students in a major way.</p>

<!--As Small as a Smile Section-->
<h2 class="section-heading">As Small as a smile</h2>
<p>Teachers and students can start making small changes towards a more collaborative environment. Something as small as a smile can change the classroom dramatically. A teacher smiling in front of her or his class could change the atmosphere from being a stressful and tiring day to a more lenient and enjoyable. These small efforts towards a positive change in the environment could lead up to a more positive bond between students and teachers, a bond that affects the motivation and perspective of a student. According to studies conducted at New York University, “When teacher form positive bonds with students, classroom become supportive spaces in which students can engage in academically and socially productive ways. ”<a href = "http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/appsych/opus/issues/2013/fall/gallagher ">(Hamre & Pianta, 2001)</a> These small bonds will start growing through time, and soon students will start asking questions they have never asked before. They will wonder without limit, and feel that they can do anything they put their minds to. This base of security will help both students and teachers with the academic goals they have and also student social-development. If a smile can do all this, imagine the possibilities!

<h2 class="section-heading">It's Not Worth It</h2>
<p>The TED Talk below is about different people learning to work together to solve problems they both face on a daily basis. Working past their differences by listening, respecting, and understanding each others views. As opinions may 
differ in politics, the same can happen in an educational environment. Here is some insight on working together to 
overcome our differences.</p>

<!--Conclusion Section-->
<h2 class="section-heading">Building Bonds</h2>
<p>At the end of the day, having a positive mindset going into anything in life will always have a positive outcome. But when it comes to school, it is one of the most important factors of being successful in your field. Being both student and teacher are stressful in their own ways, so being able to help each other out could take away the unnecessary barriers that we put ourselves through on a daily basis. Now the question is how do we start building these relations? For example, Patriot High School has an advisory period that is dedicated to building this bond between their students and teachers. With this, they will have a deeper and more comfortable conversation with someone they know for a longer period of time. This is one solution but we want to hear from you if there is any other way a teachers and students could build their bond with one another.</p>

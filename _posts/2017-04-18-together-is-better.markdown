<p>The bond between students and teachers is imperative to their success. Many times the relationship between students and teachers is 
misunderstood. One party feels that the other is not doing enough, while the other party thinks they are already doing too much.  A good 
relationship is not always encouraged within the education system; because the system dictates that the purpose of school is to get a 
superficial grade, not to build relationships that will encourage growth and exploration. This twitter poll of the Viking community shows 
that the community feels a good relationship will positively contribute to their education.

<p>The twitter poll shows us that students only have around 1-2 teachers they feel comfortable with, and at the same time, they feel that 
a relationship has a significant impact on grades. Take a close look at both polls, it is evident that the community is not experiencing 
this needed relationship.

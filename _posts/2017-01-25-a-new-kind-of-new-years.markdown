<!-- Start -->
<p>With another year behind us, a new one in motion, it is time to start setting those resolutions again. I will exercise this year, I will get all A’s, I will stop procrastinating, I will earn more money, we hear them over and over every year. Goals we set on January 1st, are usually long gone before February, but could these goals if properly executed, be the solution to our extracurricular, behavioral, and academic troubles?

<!-- Background Information -->
<p>Some teachers here at Woodbridge, from all different subjects and grades, assign goal activities for their students to complete. Some of the students and teachers also assign goals for themselves. Those goals can range between many different topics depending on the individual and the class. A few examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Behavioral </li>
  <li>Fitness</li>
  <li>Extra-Curricular</li>
  <li>Organizational</li>
  <li>Attendance</li>
  <li>Educational </li>
</ul>

<p>Classrooms are changing every year along with the new generations that enter them. Teachers set new goals for students in hopes to help them adapt to the environment they are going to be in everyday. Setting goals will allow students to visualize where they are, and where they want to be by a certain time. Ms. Landes, a World History One teacher, implements goals in order to help her students trace their progress and personal growth. After a short time with this program in place, she says</p>

<!-- Ms. Landes Quote -->
<blockquote>I have seen certain students being matched with tutors, and once the other freshman saw the progress, it was something they wanted for themselves. Soon everyone was asking for personal tutors to aid them in setting, chasing, and achieving their goals. I am hoping that in the near future, all students will see how beneficial goals can be for their futures, their education, and for themselves.</blockquote>

<!-- Landes Quote Explanation -->
<p>This is a step in the right direction for helping students increase their performance in the classroom because it allows them, as well as their teachers, to see the concrete evidence supporting their advancements. This is just implementation of goals, but what about mentors?</p>

<!-- Goals and Mentors Section -->
<h2 class="section-heading">Goals with Mentors</h2>
<p>Mr. Turner runs a program within Woodbridge to help students who feel suppressed by the current education system. These feelings manifest themselves into extra curricular, behavioral, and educational problems. These students are currently working with mentors to set goals that fit their individual needs, and the progress seen within these students is monumental. This programs aims not to force these students to conform, but instead helps the students to consciously adapt to the education system in a way that allows them to still fully express themselves. Mr. Turner says</p>

<!-- Mr.Turner quote -->
<blockquote>It starts early. If a freshman is participating in this type of program, the student can be aware of the problems and their consequences before the problems start to occur. We can help students understand the impact their decisions will have on the rest of their lives by allowing them to set goals for themselves, and build relationships with mentors that have been in their shoes.</blockquote>

<!-- Turner quote Explanation -->
<p>Schools need more of these individual experiences within the classroom. We cannot have mentors for every student in school, but we don’t really need to. Our teachers are already great at this! Building the bond between a teacher and a student can bring out the passion for learning in any student, and these experiences help students become independent and brave, which in turn allows them to become who they want to be.</p>

<p>It is said that the biggest tragedy in life lies not in aiming high and missing, but in aiming low and hitting. The fear of failing to complete a goal is actually what keeps most from chasing and completing those goals. Students learn best when taught by other students. A program that implements this approach is Future Focus. Scott Morgan, the executive chair of Future Focus, informs us</p>

<!-- Scott Morgan quote -->
<blockquote>Future Focus is a student led program aiming at offering guidance to students who seek it. Setting goals is extremely important because some students might not yet realize what they want to do after high school ends.</blockquote>

<!-- Scott Morgan Explanation and Abney quote-->
<p>This is just another way that goals can have an impact early on in someone's life. Setting goals now can prepare students for what lies ahead. Ms. Abney, principal of Woodbridge Senior High School, says</p>

<!-- Abney Quote -->
<blockquote>Goal setting is important because they serve as small milestones that will guide you to your greater goal. You will start to see the steps you need to take, and the support you will need from others to reach this greater goal. I also believe it is important for teachers to know student goals, because they can be the support that students will need to succeed.</blockquote>

<!-- Abney quote explanation -->
<p>Collaboration between students and teachers, although proven to be effective and inspiring (to teachers as well as students), is not seen nearly enough within the classroom.</p>

<!-- Set Perfect Goals, and Don’t Stop Section -->
<h2 class="section-heading">Set Perfect Goals, and Don’t Stop</h2>
<p>According to a study on new year’s resolutions, 42 percent of people lose sight of their goals within the first month after setting them. They also found that 38 percent of people always fail to meet their goals. The key to achieving the goal is to have character. Character is the ability to pursue a goal long after the excitement of the moment has passed. Who are you as a person, and why do you want to reach this goal? The answers to these questions will empower you to express yourself to your fullest, and to not give up. Aim for perfection knowing you will never reach it, and you will succeed time and time again.</p>

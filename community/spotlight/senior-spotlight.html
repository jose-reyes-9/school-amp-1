occupation: "Musician"
quote: "Talent doesn’t make you successful, effort does. Grind all day."
custom-question1: "What’s your experience in the music tech program like?"
custom-question2: "How is it performing at talent shows at Woodbridge?"
custom-question3: "What’s been your favorite performance during your time at Woodbridge?"
custom-question4: ""

custom-answer1: "So the music tech program has been in shambles ever since I actually got to be a part of it. It's not even at the school anymore, despite cfpa remaining s part of the school for its graduating seniors. It was only me and Josh Artiga, and the teacher quit less than a month into our joining the class. All that said, I love the program more than anything I've done in high school, partially because I enjoy being the underdog or having pointless setbacks that most people don't have to experience and don't pay attention to, but also because it's taught me more than I could ask for about the real world of music. After ms Gunn quit and, a month later, Mr Gerogosian, or Mr. G, came in and radically changed the music tech ideas. Previously it had been all about podcasts and manufacturing music on computers and in recording, which more fits the description of the class, but didn't have any teachings on application to the real world. Mr. G, an established musician, taught on this, and it's why I appreciate everything he's done in his short time at woodbridge. He taught us about how to succeed and thrive in the real world, not just the skills of recording, mixing, and maintaining sound for both songs or performances, but how to apply that to the real world. It was really a great experience that I was so lucky to have at woodbridge, and I hope the students at colgan are thriving in it now, hopefully with a teacher as good as Mr G."
custom-answer2: "The talent show was awesome. Simple as that. Both years I was in it I worked with Christian and Jon for our performance, and each time it was surreal. They're such talented lyricists, and I admire that more than their musical skill simply because it's something I lack, and therefore, appreciate in others. Besides the theme of Glory in junior year, everything we've performed was original, including their verses. This was awesome just because writing and performing pure expressions of your ideas is an experience which should never be passed up by any artist."
custom-answer3: "As for my favorite performance, I have two. So first was talent show performance of glory. Though it was the least original of our performances, it drew more crowd interaction than anything jon or Christian and I had ever done. Though senior years songs were, in my opinion, much better (probably because of originality), the consistent sound difficulties and low turnout (more resulting from the date of the performance than anything) kinda took away from the energy of the two, which I need to really become invested in a performance. Thus, Glory in junior year was the best of the talent show. Still, there's another contender for favorite performance. Late junior year, I had a house party with music that was simply amazing. I'd asked a few musicians from woodbridge to come out and perform just for the enjoyment of the party and they came and it was wild. The band New Minority, as well as Tra Williams and Daevon (???) performed. I was also lucky enough to be graced with the presence of Mr jon and Christian, who also showed their stuff. Still, naturally, because I'm the single most narcissistic human being on the planet, left my own band for last, consisting of the two Ryans (Crow and Blaine) and myself. Originally I had planned for the show to be in the garage, but rain forced us inside and we had the party in the basement. Needless to say, it was packed. Still, this boosted the energy level ten fold. When we went on, playing originals and covers like stacys mom and fat lip, the crowd was singing along and head banging the whole show, which made it all the better. The house party environment of this show was what made it amazing, and the energy certainly puts it st the top of my list of favorite performances"

set-answer2: "People care here. Simple as that. And I'm not really referring to the teachers. I mean every school has it's great, life changing teachers, and we certainly have one of the most facilitative principals and administrative staffs that I've ever heard of, but I'm specifically talking about the students. People here care about what they do; they're not too cool to be passionate about something, and our collective passion is what helps us succeed as much as we do, in all aspects."
set-answer3: "Well I'm going to UVA, and this is for 2 reasons. Reason number one is they have such strong academics and reputation, especially for my intended major (Business Analytics). I can't wait to continue to be in an environment where people are passionate about what they do and work hard for. Second reason is to start a band. Like most musicians my age, a career in performing music is my dream, and Charlottesville is the perfect place to do that. The college town atmosphere, coupled with the music scene's history help it to be one of the best places in the country to pursue these goals, and I'm beyond excited to attend"
set-answer4: "Relaxxxxxxxxxx oh goodness just relax. Don't stress don't stress don't stress. Its all about meeting every single one of your responsibilities the best way possible, but making sure you don't have too many. I've turned down opportunities to join student council and marching band, but look at where that's gotten me now. Pick and choose your battles, but win every single one of them."
set-answer5: "Goofball."
set-answer6: "I just talk to em. I work more on the ground level here, trying to be as good of s friend to every one of my friends as possible, delivering unwavering kindness and respect. I try and be open to everyone so that I can be reached by any and every one who may need help, because there's nothing I want to do more than provide it. I try to inspire people simply by being there for them and providing unconditional support."

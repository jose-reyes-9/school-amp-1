custom-question1: "How did it feel winning the Talent Show?"
custom-question2: "Were you hesitant to try out at all?"
custom-question3: "What is music to you?"
custom-question4: "How was your experience at Multicultural Night?"

custom-answer1: "Winning the Talent Show was really incredible. I wasn't expecting it at all, especially having listened to all of the other talented acts. I was really grateful. This is my first (and last) year at Woodbridge, and I had never met most of my classmates who were cheering me on and voting for me. It was so amazing to feel that sense of community so strongly and all at once."
custom-answer2: "I was a little hesitant because I know this school is so full of talent. That was intimidating. Not to mention, Woodbridge is HUGE. But, I hadn't performed on stage in a while, and I really wanted to participate, so I overcame my anxiousness."
custom-answer3: "It's hard to describe exactly what music is for me without getting a little bit corny and clichéd, but I suppose clichés exist for a reason. There is something about listening to your favorite artists that fills you up inside. My favorites happen to be Billy Joel, The Lumineers and James Taylor, among many others. Playing their songs has the same effect. Learning new music is a good way to always challenge myself. Mastering a new song after working at it is a great feeling, as anyone who plays an instrument or sings could tell you."
custom-answer4: "I was really excited to play at Multicultural Night. I've lived overseas much of my life, and it has taught me that learning about and experiencing new cultures is essential. Not only that, it is fun and exciting. I'm in love with the French language, and as we've already established, I'm in love with music, so I was so excited to combine the two!"

set-answer1: "Since I'm moving at the end of the year, I suppose leaving legacies is the aspect of the theme that plays out the most in my day-to-day. I was lucky enough to be able to leave a legacy with my talent show win, but daily, I hope I can be remembered at Woodbridge for always working hard and being kind, and that is something I try to accomplish every day. I think if I try to do both those things, I can build bridges and close gaps as a byproduct."
set-answer2: "This school has so much spirit. I have never been anywhere so committed to developing a sense of community, and it shows. That is evidenced in the way the Class of 2019 cheered for me at the Talent Show, even though most of them might never have seen me before. I was immediately one of them, and it really says something about this school and this community." 
set-answer3: "I am planning on coming back to the States for college, after I graduate high school from the International School of Brussels, Belgium. I'm not positive what I want to study yet, but I love history, politics, and writing. I'm the ultimate nerd, so that will probably be blatantly obvious in my choice of major."
set-answer4: "I do not know if I'm quite qualified to give advice, but I would only say that you shouldn't take yourself too seriously. I'm so klutzy, I learned a long time ago to laugh at myself. If you trip in front of the whole class, finish it with jazz hands to add some pizzazz."
set-answer5: "I'm no good at these kinds of questions—I always feel the need to text my friends and ask them to describe me. If I did, I would probably get words like 'opinionated,' 'nerdy,' or 'sensible.'"
set-answer6: "I do not know if I really inspire people, but if I do, I think it comes back to working hard and being kind. I try to do those two things every day. You can't do anything unless you work hard, and you can't go anywhere unless you are kind to people. My dad likes to remind me that when you make mistakes, people are more forgiving when you are nice to them. They don't cut you as much slack if you are a pill. So even though it may seem like you are helping others by being kind to them, in the end, what goes around comes around in the best way."

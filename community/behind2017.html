<!-- Description of behind 2017 -->
<p>Behind 2017 is a documentary series and episodic narrative produced to
  eternalize the nuances of Woodbridge Senior High School as well as the teenage
  experience. The series documents student leaders of the class of 2017 in
  school activities and community outreach. People say that high school was the
  best time of their life, and many of these people will tell you they took it
  for granted. The goal of producing this digital time capsule is that today,
  and years down the road, every one of our fellow classmates can take a
  step back and appreciate the magic of high school. If you have questions
